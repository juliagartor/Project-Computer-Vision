# Computer Vision: Class Project

The purpose of this project is to provide efficient solutions for two different problems: Pasta Image and Product Image. 

## Pasta Image

In this problem, we were given an image in which different types of pasta appeared. The
goal of this first challenge was to count the number of elements of each type and provide
separate images with only one kind of pasta.
